<h2> Extraneous Data Removal </h2>

```{r extraneous data removal, eval = T}
if("SESTRAT" %in% names(cpes.cleaned)){
  cpes.cleaned <- cpes.cleaned %>% select(-starts_with("V") & -starts_with("NC") & -starts_with("NS") & -starts_with("NL") & -starts_with("CPES") & -c("SESTRAT", "SECLUSTR"))
}
cpes.cleaned$householdIncome[cpes.cleaned$householdIncome < 10000] <- NA
cpes.cleaned$parents.USBorn <- cpes.cleaned$parents.USBorn - rep(1, nrow(cpes.cleaned))
cpes.cleaned$employment.initialAge[cpes.cleaned$employment.initialAge > cpes.cleaned$age] <- NA

cpes.cleaned$motherDeath.respondentAge[cpes.cleaned$motherDeath.respondentAge > cpes.cleaned$age] <- NA
cpes.cleaned$closeFamily.alive[cpes.cleaned$closeFamily.alive > 25] <- NA
```

Extraneous or unusual data is either modified or removed.<br>
Annual household incomes below 10,000 are removed, as there is high likelihood they are typos.<br>
US Born Parent variable values are mutated to be one less than their original value so numeric values now align with number of US born parents.<br>
Initial employment age, respondent age at mother's death, and respondent age at father's death are all removed if the value is greater than respondent's current age.
Alive close family values above 25 are removed. Respondents likely did not interpret close family as commonly accepted.<br>

<h1>Exploratory Data Analysis</h1>
We conduct a brief EDA, looking at surface level trends in depression rate for region, sex, age, race, income, employment, and education

<h2>Region</h2>

```{r EDA: Region, eval = T, include = T}
region_depression.lifetime <- select(cpes.cleaned, c("region", "depression.lifetime"))

region_Pop <- as.data.frame(table(region_depression.lifetime[,"region"])) %>%

uniqueRegions <- length(unique(region_depression.lifetime$region))
region_depressionPop.lifetime <- as.data.frame(
  table(region_depression.lifetime[region_depression.lifetime$depression.lifetime == '1',]))[1:uniqueRegions,] %>% 
  rename("endorsed" = Freq)

region_depression.lifetime <- cbind(region_Pop, region_depressionPop.lifetime$endorsed) %>% rename("endorsed" = "region_depressionPop.lifetime$endorsed") %>% mutate(rate = endorsed / population)

region_depression.lifetime <- region_depression.lifetime[region_depression.lifetime$population >= 30,]

region_depression.lifetime$region <- factor(region_depression.lifetime$region, 
                                           levels = unique(region_depression.lifetime$region)
                                           [order(region_depression.lifetime$rate, decreasing = F)])

regionDist.plot <- plot_ly(region_depression.lifetime, x = ~region, y = ~population, type = 'bar') %>% 
  layout(title = "Population by Region", xaxis = list(title = "Region"), yaxis = list(title = "Population", range = c(0, 8000)))

region_depression.lifetime.plot
```

The South appears to be over-represented in our sample. Though, that should not skew the depression rate measures in the second graph, in which the South appears to be the least depressed at 13% vs. the Midwest's 17%

<h2>Gender</h2>

```{r eda sex, eval = T, include = T}
sex_depression.lifetime <- select(cpes.cleaned, c("sex", "depression.lifetime"))

sex_depression.lifetime$sex <- factor(sex_depression.lifetime$sex, 
                                           levels = unique(sex_depression.lifetime$sex)
                                           [order(sex_depression.lifetime$rate, decreasing = F)])

sex_depression.lifetime.plot
```

Females are over-represented in our sample. They also have a higher depression rate at 16.9% compared to 10.5% for males

<h2>Age</h2>

```{r eda age, eval = F, include = T}
age_depression.12Month <- select(cpes.cleaned, c("age", "depression.12Month"))

age_Pop <- as.data.frame(table(age_depression.12Month[,"age"])) %>%

ageDist.plot

age_depression.12Month <- age_depression.12Month[age_depression.12Month$population >= 30,]
age_depression.12Month %<>% mutate_at(c("age"), as.numeric)

         xaxis = list(title = "Age"), 
         yaxis = list(title = "% Positive for MDD (12Month)", range = c(0,0.25))) %>%
  add_trace(x = ~age, y = fitted(age_depression.12Month.fit), mode = 'lines')
age_depression.12Month.plot
summary(age_depression.12Month.fit)
```

The age distribution matches that of the United States. For the graph of depression rates, ages from 87 to 99 were excluded, as they had less than 30 observations. Depression rate appears to generally trend downward as age increases.

<h2>Race</h2>

```{r eda race, eval = F, include = T}
race_depression.lifetime <- select(cpes.cleaned, c("race", "depression.lifetime"))

race_Pop <- as.data.frame(table(race_depression.lifetime[,"race"])) %>%

                                           [order(race_depression.lifetime$rate, decreasing = F)])

raceDist.plot <- plot_ly(race_depression.lifetime, x = ~race, y = ~population, type = 'bar') %>% 
  layout(title = "Population by Race", xaxis = list(title = "Race"), yaxis = list(title = "Population", range = c(0, 8000)))

race_depression.lifetime.plot
```

The race distribution generally matches that of the United States. Depression rate appears to be the highest for "All Other" Minorities, Non-Hispanic Whites, and Puerto Ricans.

<h2>Household Income</h2>

```{r eda householdIncome, eval = F, include = T}
householdIncome_depression.12Month <- select(cpes.cleaned, c("householdIncome", "depression.12Month"))

householdIncome_depression.12Month <- mutate(householdIncome_depression.12Month, householdIncome = round_any(householdIncome, 5000, f = floor))

  add_trace(x = ~householdIncome, y = fitted(householdIncome_depression.12Month.fit), mode = 'lines')
householdIncome_depression.12Month.plot

summary(householdIncome_depression.12Month.fit)
```

Income distribution appears to generally follow that of the United States, though our model has income capped at 200,000. Incomes have also been rounded to the nearest floor by increments of 5000, and observations of less than 30 have been omitted. Depression rate generally decreases from 10k to 100k, increases from 100k to 145k, drops at 150k, and remains steady afterward, with perhaps a slight increase.

<h2>Employment</h2>

```{r eda employment, eval = F, include = T}
employment.current_depression.lifetime <- select(cpes.cleaned, c("employment.current", "depression.lifetime"))

employment.current_Pop <- as.data.frame(table(employment.current_depression.lifetime[,"employment.current"])) %>%

employment.current_depression.lifetime$employment.current <- factor(employment.current_depression.lifetime$employment.current, 
                                           levels = unique(employment.current_depression.lifetime$employment.current)
                                           [order(employment.current_depression.lifetime$rate, decreasing = F)])

employment.currentDist.plot <- plot_ly(employment.current_depression.lifetime, x = ~employment.current, y = ~population, type = 'bar') %>% 
  layout(title = "Population by employment.current", xaxis = list(title = "employment.current"), yaxis = list(title = "Population", range = c(0, 15000)))

employment.current_depression.lifetime.plot
```

Employment distribution generally resembles that of the United States, save for a slightly higher than expected rate of respondents not in the labor force. Employment appears to lower depression rates, as "Not in Labor Force" and "Unemployed" groups have the highest depression rates.

<h2>Education</h2>

summary(yearsOfEducation.respondent_depression.lifetime.fit)
```

The education distribution is as expected, and representative of the United States, with an expected peak at 12 years. To plot depression rates, respondents of less than 23 years of age were excluded for the purpose of modeling lifetime risk of depression. Save for a peak at 4 years of education, depression rates generally trend upwards as people get more educated, until it plateaus at around 13.

<h2>Pairwise</h2>

Pairwise plot of all continuous variables. High level assessment for multicollinearity, and potential interesting relationships between variables.

<h1> Assessing 30 day Risk Of Testing Positive for MDD </h1>

All predictive modeling techniques below will use the same testing set (NAs omitted) to determine MCE, Sensitivity, and Specificity. Training sets will be modified accordingly as not all models natively handle NAs. Via random sampling, all training sets are balanced to ensure an about equal distribution of endorsed and not endorsed observations. This is to prevent the model learning to predict consistently "not endorsed" without proper consideration of feature values, as our data is heavily skewed in that manner. The base training and testing set however, is made of a 65:20 split of all observations where 30 day depression endorsement is valid. The remaining 15 are allocated to a validation set for final model comparison.

Variables of interest relevant to a 30 day prediction are: *physicalHealth* *socialLifeDifficulty*, *healthWorkAbsence*, difficultyRemembering,  daysMobilityDifficult, daysOvertime, difficultyConcentrating, difficultyUnderstandingSituation, and jobPerformance.

Bolded variables have a missingness of less than 60%

<h2>Null Model</h2>

We identify our optimal tree as the one with the lowest overall MCE while maintaining a high Sensitivity and Specificity. Trees were trained on two versions of the training set, imputed and unimputed. Missing values in the imputed training set were imputed using rfImpute from the randomForest package. Our best tree was iteration 5 of the imputed training set, with MCE = 0.172, Sensitivity = 0.6029, Specificity = 0.8331, and important variables socialLifeDifficulty, difficultyUnderstandingSituation, healthWorkAbsence, and difficultyRemembering (ordered from most to least important)

<h2>Random Forest</h2>

Forests were grown from preimputed (rfImpute performed on entire dataset of interest variables, training set was then selected from imputed dataset), postimputed (rfImpute performed on training set selected from dataset still with NAs), and unimputed training sets (randomForest cannot handle NAs, so NAs were omitted for unimputed training sets). Additionally, the procedures were repeated for two sets of variables: "allVars" and "goodVars". "allVars" contains all 9 variables of interest, while "goodVars" contains only the ones with missingness below 60%.

Once more, we identify our optimal forest as the one with the lowest overall MCE while maintaining a high Sensitivity and Specificity.

The best model was our postimputed forest with mtry = 4, and number of NAs allowed in training set before imputation set to 3: MCE = 44.4%, Sensitivity = 0.667, Specificity = 0.625. Ranked by importance according to mean decrease gini, the most important variables were daysMobilityDifficult, jobPerformance, and daysOvertime. For important variables, this appears to contradict our single tree model.

<h2>LASSO</h2>

Like randomForest, our LASSO function cannot handle NA values in either the testing or the training sets. LASSO algorithms will trained on preimputed, postimputed, and unimputed training sets for both "allVars" and "goodVars". The criterion for selecting optimal algorithm remains the same.

The optimal algorithm was our LASSO trained on a allVars postimputed training set, where initial NAs allowed per row was set to 3 and threshold was set to 0.48: MCE = 0.109, Sensitivity = 0.667, Specificity = 0.907. difficultyUnderstandingSituation, socialLifeDifficulty, and healthWorkAbsence had non-zero coefficients in the model

<h2>boosting</h2>
```{r boosting 30day, eval = T}
train <- readRDS("data/30dayTrain_imputed.Rda")
testOne <- na.omit(readRDS("data/30dayTestOne_unimputed.Rda"))
train <- train[,c(10, 1:9)]

trainm <- sparse.model.matrix(depression.30day~.-1, data = train)
train_label <- train[,"depression.30day"]
train_matrix <- xgb.DMatrix(data = as.matrix(trainm), label = train_label)

testm <- trainm <- sparse.model.matrix(depression.30day~.-1, data = testOne)
```

<h2>deep learning</h2>
```{r deep learning 30day, eval = T}

```

<h2>k nearest neighbor</h2>
```{r k nearest neighbor, eval = T}

```

<h2>naive bayes</h2>
```{r naive bayes, eval = T}

```
